                <p>Jungle Diamonds is a slightly indica dominant hybrid strain (60% indica/40% sativa) created through
                    crossing the infamous Slurricane X Gorilla Glue #4 strains. Named for its gorgeous appearance and
                    breeder,
                    Jungle Diamonds is a favorite of indica and hybrid lovers alike thanks to its delicious taste and
                    tingly,
                    arousing high. Jungle Diamonds buds have sparkling oversized spade-shaped olive green nugs with vivid
                    amber hairs and a thick frosty blanket of glittering tiny blue-tinted white crystal trichomes. As you
                    pull
                    apart each sticky little nugget, aromas of spicy mocha coffee and fruity herbs are released. </p>
                <p>The flavor is of sweet chocolate with hints of fresh ripe berries to it, too. The Jungle Diamonds high
                    is
                    just as delicious, with happy effects that will boost the spirits and kick negative thoughts and moods
                    to
                    the curb. You'll feel a tingly sense in your body from start to finish that serves to remove any aches
                    or
                    pains while leaving you pretty aroused at times. This is accompanied by a blissfully unfocused heady
                    lift
                    that leaves your head in the clouds without causing sedation. With these effects and its pretty high
                    17-24% THC level, Jungle Diamonds is ideal for experienced patients with chronic pain, cramps or muscle
                    spasms and appetite loss or nausea.</p>
